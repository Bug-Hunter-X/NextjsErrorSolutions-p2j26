# Next.js LocalStorage Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications when accessing local storage data directly within a page component.  The error occurs when the page attempts to access data that may not yet exist. This is commonly seen if a user navigates directly to the route instead of going through a process to set it.  The solution involves conditional rendering and error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the data is unavailable.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate directly to `/about`. You should see an error because the `user` object is undefined.
5. Navigate to the home page and then to the `/about` page; now the error will not occur because local storage is set.  

## Solution

The provided solution shows how to handle this potential error and gracefully render the page regardless of whether the data exists or not.  It shows good practices for handling this scenario.
